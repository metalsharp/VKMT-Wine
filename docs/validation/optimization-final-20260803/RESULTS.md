# VKMT candidate optimization plan — final acceptance lane receipt

Date: 2026-08-03

This is the final receipt for the work completed in this pass. It inventories
the source/runtime promotions, candidate evaluations, prepared-prefix result,
and current acceptance lane gates. It does not claim that an unsafe or unmeasured candidate source
rewrite was promoted.

## Final gates

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Existing-prefix ARM64 Wineboot --update | rc=0 |
| ARM64 fixture | rc=0 |
| ARM64EC fixture | rc=0 |
| x86_64 fixture | rc=0 |
| i386/WoW64 fixture | rc=0 |
| WoW64 VM contract | WOW64_VM_CONTRACT_ALL_OK |
| i386 FEX invalidation | correlated nonzero maintenance summary |
| MSync manual pulse | PASS |
| MSync auto pulse | PASS |
| MSync WaitAll rollback | PASS |
| MSync stale-port/fallback | PASS; 11 recoveries and 11 diagnostics |
| CEF x86_64 OSR | pixel marker and rc=0 |
| acceptance lane hot-set | PASS; 62.00% cold stall reduction |

After the NTDLL promotion, the existing canonical prefix was run through
`wine wineboot.exe --update` without prefix creation or reset; the result was
`rc=0`. Evidence is `wineboot-after-ntdll.txt`.
Wineboot refreshed one built-in graphics file and removed one staged i386
closure file, so the canonical prefix was repaired with the non-creating
`scripts/vkmt-prefix refresh --prefix PATH` operation. The subsequent prepared
acceptance lane run passed all four architecture markers with status 0. This establishes
the required ordering: final Wineboot first, then one prefix refresh, then
prepared runtime gates.

The active runner is scripts/probe-p8-single-prefix-architectures.sh. acceptance lane
names are retained only for historical provenance; new provider acceptance
uses acceptance lane names.

## Performance result

The final acceptance lane hot-set retry measured:

- cold_physical_gbps=0.865709
- effective_gbps=2.273383
- total_gbps=1.034158
- blocking_stall_reduction_pct=62.00
- warm_regression_pct=2.52

The earlier accepted acceptance lane hot-set receipt measured 61.45% reduction; both are
well above the 25% gate. The promoted NTDLL scan candidate adds a focused
opt-in helper result: absent/end-marker scans improved from 0.319/0.325 ms to
0.014 ms at 4 KiB, 5.357/5.339 ms to 0.177 ms at 64 KiB, and
91.403/97.953 ms to 2.799 ms at 1 MiB over 100 calls. These are helper-level
measurements, not a claim about total Steam startup time.

Previously promoted runtime optimizations already present in this Wine tree
also have retained measurements:

- acceptance lane loader/session caching reduced initial-process dyld resolutions from
  1,140 to 590 and failed path probes from 10 to 5; warm p95 was 21.940/21.986
  ms for x86_64 and 68.915/69.112 ms for i386.
- acceptance lane WineVulkan procedure-availability batching reduced representative i386
  Unix calls by 48.6% for DXGI, 26.6% for D3D12, and 39.8% for D3D11.
- acceptance lane hot-set staging reduced cold blocking stall by 58.41% in its original
  acceptance and 62.00% in the final retry.

The complete changed-file inventory is
docs/validation/optimization-final-20260803/changed-files.tsv.
It records 98 root paths and 16 nested-Wine paths relative to the start of
this pass. The 82-file source ledger is docs/OPTIMIZATION_LEDGER.tsv.
The supplemental candidate disposition matrix is
`docs/OPTIMIZATION_DISPOSITION.tsv`; it records one accepted helper, two
rejected candidates, four profiled no-safe-candidate rows, and eight paths
blocked by ABI, pointer, lock, TLS, ordering, or FEX boundaries.
The disposition validator passed with `candidates=15`; it is part of the
optimizer verification command and does not turn unresolved rows green.
The remaining 12 candidate rows are audited and dispositioned at
`docs/validation/optimization-candidate-review-20260803/RESULTS.md`.
The prepared-prefix Winsock address-list contract also passed with
`VKMT_X64_ADDRESS_LIST_SORT_OK`; its receipt is
`docs/validation/address-list-sort-final-canonical-20260803/RESULTS.md`.

## Candidate disposition and remaining boundary

The hashed NTDLL loader cache candidate was compiled and tested against paired
control runs, but was rejected: the extended candidate median/P95 became
slower and noisier. Its source was restored and the actual Wine build was
rebuilt from the committed source. It was not installed. The separate
`dlls/ntdll/unix/file.c::buffer_contains()` candidate was accepted and is
installed in the actual nested Wine source/build; its receipt is
`docs/validation/optimization-file-scan-20260803/RESULTS.md`.
No claim is made that the remaining custom C corpus is optimized.

The protected loader, exception, signal, WoW64, FEX dispatcher/JIT, MSync,
Vulkan, and graphics callback files remain manual-review unless a measured
pure leaf candidate is found. CEF x64 is accepted; i386 CEF remains an
explicit unresolved compatibility boundary. The nested Wine remote is still
configured to an unavailable local archive path, so nested commits are
retained locally while VKMT documentation is pushed to GitHub.

The first follow-on Workstream 2 heap candidate is recorded separately at
`docs/validation/optimization-heap-index-20260803/RESULTS.md`.
It compiled to the exact same `ntdll.so` as control and was rejected without
promotion; the current final runtime hashes and acceptance lane gate therefore remain
unchanged.

The first FEX Workstream 4 candidate is recorded at
`docs/validation/optimization-fex-mask-20260803/RESULTS.md`. It
passed direct x86_64 functional checks but was 1.54% slower and was rejected;
the canonical acceptance lane provider and all-architecture gate remain unchanged.

Therefore the functional/runtime acceptance lane gate is green, but the stronger claim
that every custom C file has been materially candidate-optimized is not made.
