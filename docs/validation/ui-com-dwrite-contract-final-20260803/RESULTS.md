## Scope

- COM STA initialization and standard IStream cross-apartment marshaling.
- STA message pumping, cross-thread callback delivery, nested SendMessage callback, completion ordering, and window destruction.
- DirectWrite factory/font collection enumeration, family/font-face lookup, glyph lookup, mixed-script text layout, and system fallback MapCharacters.
- `UNSUPPORTED` rows are explicit known provider gaps; they are not reported as passes.
- CEF/WebView actual text/pixel output is a separate browser evidence gate.
- Font source candidates `dlls/dwrite/freetype.c` and `dlls/win32u/freetype.c` are not changed by this fixture.

Environment: FEX_TSOENABLED=0, FEX_VECTORTSOENABLED=0, FEX_MEMCPYSETTSOENABLED=0, wineboot=not-run.
