# WinSock contract — acceptance lane

Prefix: `/Volumes/AverySSD/VKMT/build/probe-runs/phase-a-graphics-prefix`

The fixture uses only loopback and `localhost`; it performs no external DNS or network access.

**Result:** all four architecture processes completed with rc=0.

## Scope

- IPv4/IPv6 loopback, offline localhost address enumeration, and address ordering.
- Nonblocking connect/SO_ERROR, select, WSAPoll, WSAEventSelect notification/rearm.
- Overlapped WSARecv with IOCP completion lifetime and parallel connect/send/close races.
- `UNSUPPORTED` rows are explicit provider capability results and are not silently converted to passes.
- TLS trust, fragmentation, proxy, COM, callback, and DirectWrite contracts are separate gates.

Environment: FEX_TSOENABLED=0, FEX_VECTORTSOENABLED=0, FEX_MEMCPYSETTSOENABLED=0, wineboot=not-run.
