## Contract

- `valid`: a localhost SAN certificate signed by an intermediate whose root is installed only in the current-user ROOT store.
- `expired`: the same hostname/chain shape with an expired leaf; it must be rejected.
- `untrusted`: a valid-shape leaf signed by a different root that is not installed; it must be rejected.
- Both WinHTTP and WinINet use normal certificate validation; no ignore-errors option is set.
- `valid-fragmented` repeats the trusted case through a local HTTP CONNECT proxy that fragments both directions (2 ms / 32-byte chunks), proving partial TLS transport handling and proxy configuration.
- Servers, certificate material, and requests are local; external DNS/network is not used.
- BoringSSL ignore-verification probes remain diagnostic-only and are not counted here.

Environment: FEX_TSOENABLED=0, FEX_VECTORTSOENABLED=0, FEX_MEMCPYSETTSOENABLED=0, wineboot=not-run.
